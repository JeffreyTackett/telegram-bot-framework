# Telegram bot

This repository contains a framework to build bots against the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots), and an actually working bot.

The framework is an action-based framework where you can configure what actions to perform when certain events occur (eg. someone enters a group, a command is sent to the bot, etc.).

You can find in [bot/manager.py](bot/manager.py) an already-configured bot using this framework.
